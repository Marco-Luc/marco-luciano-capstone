# NBA - My Starting Five

**_NBA - My Starting Five is a fun and interactive application for comparing NBA Player stats with custom-made digital NBA Player cards_**

**_Please note that the only pages that are available are the Toronto Raptors team page, the Boston Celtics team page, and the Compare Stats page_**

This is my capstone project for BrainStation's bootcamp. Students were tasked to create their very own full-stack application within a two week time frame.

NBA - My Starting Five was made using create-react-app, react-router and SASS for the front end.

I used Node/Express to create a backend API with data I retrieved myself.

üèÄ Thank you for checking out my application, I hope you had fun! üèÄ
